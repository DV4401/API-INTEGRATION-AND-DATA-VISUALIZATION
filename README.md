This Python script integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data for a specified city (e.g., Hyderabad). It processes the data to extract key metrics like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover, then uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create a visualization dashboard. The dashboard features four subplots: a bar plot comparing actual and "feels like" temperatures, a bar plot of humidity and cloud cover, a wind speed gauge, and a text box displaying the weather condition and timestamp. The script saves the output as a high-resolution PNG file (weather_dashboard.png) and displays it interactively.
